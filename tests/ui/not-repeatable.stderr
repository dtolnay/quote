    = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
            `Ipv4Addr: Iterator`
            which is required by `Ipv4Addr: ext::RepIteratorExt`
            `Ipv4Addr: IntoIterator`
            which is required by `Ipv4Addr: ext::RepIntoIteratorExt`
            `Ipv4Addr: Copy`
            which is required by `Ipv4Addr: ext::RepIntoIteratorExt`
            `&Ipv4Addr: Iterator`

            `&mut Ipv4Addr: Copy`
            which is required by `&mut Ipv4Addr: ext::RepIntoIteratorExt`
note: the following traits must be implemented
   --> src/to_tokens.rs
    |
    | pub trait ToTokens {
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    |
   ::: $RUST/core/src/iter/traits/collect.rs
    |
    | pub trait IntoIterator {
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    |
   ::: $RUST/core/src/iter/traits/iterator.rs
    |
    | pub trait Iterator {
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::quote_bind_into_iter` which comes from the expansion of the macro `quote` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `Ipv4Addr` with `#[derive(Clone, Copy)]`
